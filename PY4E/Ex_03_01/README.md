# WHAT
# A simple pay cal helping compute weekly earnings of an employee
# Based on number hours worked and the houly rate

# The program prompts you to input hours and rate
# It then Converts your input(string) into appropriate data types - floating point
# We then continue to Check if hours exceeds 40 - which is the standard time for work week
# Should it be true means you have worked overritme
# - It then cal's regular pay
# - Calculates overrtime pay, @ half the hourly rate 1.5 
# - and adds both to get total pay
# if not then it just calculates regular pay
# - Multiplies hours by rate
# Then prints Normal pay

# WHY

# Also is a good excercise for understanding input, if-else, castin and basic arithmetic

# HOW
# Can use it to track one's pay or for small business payroll tool
# Good for learning more on data types and conversion int() and float
# - conditional logic (if, else)

# IMprovements
# Multpiple employees entries
# Saving data to a file or database
