# WHAT
# A simple grading script that takes in a score and prints out a corresponding letter grade based on a scale.
# It prompts the user to input a score between 0.0 and 1.0
# Converts t from string to float
# It then checks which range the score falls into and assigns a grade

# WHY
# It would be useful as it introduces condistional statements
# Teaching range checking
# Demostrating basic input validation
# And great for turning into a function later.

# HOW
# Can be very useful for education platforms taking in stdents test scores
# - Converting them into letter grades
# - storing or displaying results on a dashboard
# As an API grading as a service - where clients use it online to grade sending their scores and getting back a gradde.
# For practice when creating terminal based apps or building small prjects with conditions and user input
