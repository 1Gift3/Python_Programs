# WHAT
# This is a simple grading script.
# Taking in a score you have inputed and prints out a corresponding letter grade based on a scale.
# Firstly it prompts you the user to input any score between 0.0 and 1.0 using an If statement.
# Converts the input from string a to float, to accomodate decimal scores.
# It then checks which range the score falls into and assigns a grade accordingly.
# Should the score be above 1.0 it prints an error message.
# It uses conditional statements to determine the grade based on the score.
# It uses a series of if, elif, and else statements to check the score against defined ranges.
# But now the elif statement is used to check for the ranges of the score.
# We define the elif as a way to check for the next condition if the previous one is not met.


# WHY
# It would be useful as it introduces conditional statements
# Teaching range checking
# Demostrating basic input validation
# And great for turning into a function later.

# HOW
# Can be very useful for education platforms taking in stdents test scores
# - Converting them into letter grades
# - storing or displaying results on a dashboard
# As an API grading as a service - where clients use it online to grade sending their scores and getting back a gradde.
# For practice when creating terminal based apps or building small projects with conditions and user input
