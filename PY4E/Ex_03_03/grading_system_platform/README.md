# Simple educational platform grading system
# WHAT
# The grading tool accepts a students test score between 0.0 and 1.0
# Converts that score into a letter grade A and F
# Stores and displays the result like a mini dashboard
# It takes a score input when the user enters a score like 0.85 or anything. its then converted into a float
# it then converts the score into a grade, if the score is not inthe vaalid range like 1.1 or -0.2 it prints an error message
# results are then stored putting the score and grade in a dictionary
# Then lastly it displays a dash board

# HOW 
# can be used in a class room or a E-learning platform
# Its logic can be put into a mobile app or django for students to check their scores
# Can be useful for practice projects or portfolio build
# to build an automatic grading tool for teachers.

# WHY
# It saves time and reduces Human error
# Automates repetitive work
# Helps track student perfomances
# easy to scale and upgrade
# And Great tool for devs to learn
