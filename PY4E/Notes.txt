 Assignment Stste - we assign a value to a variable using assign statement (=)


TYpe conversions
In an expression statement when you put an integer awith a floating point - the int is converted to a float.

We use built-in function int() and float()

Integer division produces a floating point result

String conversionsWe can use int() and float() to convert betweenstrings and int'says

User input 
We user input() function, to pause and read data of the user onto python.
n.b input() function will alwasy bring a string (always)

Converting user input

Def Function like an if,for and while state end with a colon :
and Two statements make up this function.

We define it once and can use it twice,

The end of an Invocation is a return value ( Function)

Loops refers to a language constructs that are used to repeatedly execute - while Iteration is the process of doing something repeatedly.( meaning how many times the loop ran over and over)

Breaking out of a loop end the current loop but then jumps to the next statement following the loop.

We have three types
- None type which has one value in it a special marker (none constant) having one value
- Boolean has True/False 
- Floating point has an infinite no- of values along with intergers.
