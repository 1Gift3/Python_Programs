# WHAT
# A simple number tracker that finds the largest and smallest numba from user input
# It asks the user to enter numbers repeatedly and when the user types done it prints
# - the largest no entered
# - the smallest number entered
# Line 20 - Updates the largest no if this number is bigger than the current largest
# also updates lowest_no if its smaller than the current lowest
# It asks for number to be inputed repeatedly
# Tracks the highest and lowest numbers entered
# Ends when the user types done
# Handles invalid inputs gracefully 
# and then prints the max and min at the end

# WHY
# It helps understand loops, input, error handling and tracking values
# it acts as a base for more advanced programs : calculators, analytics and data filtering
# Also great intro to using none as a placeholder in logic
