# This is a text processing script
# it reads a file romeo.txt and it creates a sorted list of all the unique words in that file

# WHAT
# It opens up the file romeo.txt
# Reads the entire content into a string called nfile
# creates an empty list list_words to hold unique words
# - .split() breaks the full text into individual words using whitespace as a separator
# loops over each word in the file, if the words is not already in the list it adds it, and after adding a neew word it sorts the list
# and prints out the sorted list of unique words

# WHY
# Can be used for vocabulary analysis
# removin duplicates from a file
# word indexing
# and text processing to clean and alalyse text (Natural language processing)

# HOW
# can be used in keyword discovery/seo work
# book or literature analysis
# preprocessing for ai/nlp projects as : almost every ai model that works with language needs : cleaned , tokenized, de-duplicated input
# finding typos or inconsistencies
# data cleaning in web scrapping
# as a great learning tool ot creating word games
