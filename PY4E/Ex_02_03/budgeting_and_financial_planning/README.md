# WHAT
# Program firsts asks the user to input their weekly working hours and hourly rate and it also asks the user what percentage of their net pay they want to save
# The gross pay is calculated by multiplying the hours worked per week by hourly rate, then multiply that by 4 weeks to estimate the monthly gross pay
# A flat rate of 10% is applied to the gross monthly pay to calculate the tax deductions
# The net pay is the gross pay minus tax deductions
# The program then calculates how much you should save based on the perentage you input, the end amount is my monthly savings
# It then prints out the gross pay, tax deductions, net pay and the amount to save based on the users savings goal
