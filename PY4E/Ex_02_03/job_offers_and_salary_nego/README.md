# WHAT
# Job offer functiooooooon makes the initial job offer with a specified base salary, it the returns the base salary to be used later in nego
# Salary nego func should the candidates expected salary be higher that the base salart, the employer makes a counteroffer thats halfwway between the base and the expected salary. The candidate is then asked whether they accept the counteroffer
# Lastly the main function runs the simulation, starting with the job offer and then proceeding to nego based on the users input for expected salary

# Improvements 
# Modify job title to reflact different job positions
# Changinging the base_salary to match the initial offer in dff scenarios
# Negotiation strategy as now the counter offer is simply 50% of the difference between the ase and expected salary. i can make the adjustment to make the nego more complex or realistic ( use ways offered on youtube to negotiate)
