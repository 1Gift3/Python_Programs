Basic Payroll Calculation:
# WHAT
At its core, the simple payroll calculation is just multiplying the hours worked by the hourly wage. This method assumes that all the hours are paid at the regular rate.

Example:
Hours Worked: 40 hours

Hourly Rate: $15.75/hour

Gross Pay: 40 * 15.75 = $630.00

# HOW
For real-world payroll purposes, we often need to account for other factors, such as:

Overtime Pay (if hours exceed 40 hours per week)

Tax Deductions (if you're including tax withholdings)

Bonuses or Deductions (like bonuses, health insurance, etc.)
