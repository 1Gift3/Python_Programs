# WHAT 
# The first part of the code uses the same principles with 2.1 with a minor change.
# We introduce 'F' string to contain the input from the user, to further finish the greetings.
# Now the code prompts you the user to input your name which then its stored the variable 'name'.
# It will after print a full greeting with name that was inputed.

# Part 2
# The program continues to prompt you the user for mood then storing in a Var

# Part 3
# Now onto conditionals
# Here the code checks you the users mood and responds
# mood.lower() makes the input first lowercase so that it can match the list provided even if you the user tpye in Boldcases.
# It will after check if the lowercase mood is one the words in the positive list.
# if yes, it then prints a positive encourgagment

# Part 4
# Should the mood not be positive (elif), the program checks if its in the negative list.
# if YES, it will then print a conforting message.

# Part 5
# If the mood isnt either the two on the list, it becomes a default case
# means the mood was something else unexpected or unique
# Giving a Neutral and supportive messages.

# Part 6
# Program then prompts you the user again for their Hobby
# Sotre the input in Variable 'hobby' 
# Then prints the message usings F-string formatting
# - where {name} assumes theres a variable name already defined somewhere 
# {hooby.capitalize()} capitalizes the first letter of the hobby for better formating.




**# Line Two uses an f-string which is a formatted string in python**

# WHAT
# What it does is that it allow me to format selected parts of a string
# WHY
# when you - Want control over formatting of out-put than simply printing space separated value.  
# HOW
# To format out-put, by beginning a string with f or F before opening qoutation mark or triple qoutation.

**# Placeholders and modifiers**
# WHY
# To format values in an f-string -y you'd need  placeholders {}
# WHAT
# It enables {name} as a container (ie - but also can contain operations,functions and modifiers) to format the value.
# HOW
# WHen i remove fstring the it prints the statement as it is "Hello, {name}!..." without input or formating the input string.

# Alternative way!
# Since its cleaner and more readerble, if you want not to use {} then you could use "+" for string concactenation

**# .Lower()**
# WHY
# is a string method that converts all characters in a string to lowercase.
# WHAT
# It ensure a consistent input handling takes place

**# Learned**
# Got reminded on how to use emojis again Windows, + and period .
