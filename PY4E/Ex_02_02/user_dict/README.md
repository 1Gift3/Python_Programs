# WHAT
# To stored more than one name, you will have to use Dictionary - Data structure ( key value Pairs)
# firstly you will have to predefine dict with stored usernames and passwords.
# The program prompts you the user to enter your name and again prompt again but this time asking for your password.
# The program will then check if what you the user has inputed  corresponds with deatils in the Dict (users_db) 
# - Should the username be found, it will continue to check if you entered password matching the stored one.
# Should both username and password match the stored values you the user will be logged in and a success message will be printed
#  - should the username or the password be incorrect an error message will then be printed

# WHY
# It provides a way to authenticate users in a program (simple), its the foundational concept of building login systems
# A dict based approach allows for easy management of user credentials espcially in small programs

# HOW
# I can use it if im building a command line tool that requres to log-in( to access or manage local databse).
# Can use it for practicing basic authentication concepts
# And can used if one is prototyping a new feature or testing a small app where complpex user authentication systems arent needed.
