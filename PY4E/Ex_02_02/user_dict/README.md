# WHAT
# The dict users_db stores the usernames as keys and their corresponding passwords as values (Dictionary)
# The code then checks if the entered username exists as a key in the dict (users_db)
# - if the username is found, it then checks if the entered password matches the stored password for that username
# Should both username and password match the stored values the user is logged in and a success message is displayed
# - should the username or the password be incorrect an error message will be shown

# WHY
# It provides a way to authenticate users in a program (simple), its the foundational concept of building login systems
# A dict based approach allows for easy management of user credentials espcially in small programs

# HOW
# I can use it if im building a command line tool that requres to log-in( to access or manage local databse).
# Can use it for practicing basic authentication concepts
# And can used if one is prototyping a new feature or testing a small app where complpex user authentication systems arent needed.
