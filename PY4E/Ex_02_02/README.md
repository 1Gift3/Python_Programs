# WHY
# The code introduces the concept of taking user input and respond to it
# Writing basic input and output

# HOW
# I can use it for personalized messages modifying it to interact chatbots or greeting applications
# Can use it to expand it by asking for password and veryfying credentials
# Can also store names and other inputs for further processing in databases or files
# Lastly can be intergrated into a game where the players name is needed

# WHAT
# This program uses input to prompt user for their name 
# and then welcomes them
# You will then input Sarah in the box.
# takes input from users input("enter name:") waits for the user to type something and press enter
# stores the input in a variable : the input stored in the variable name
# it then prints the greeting with name.
