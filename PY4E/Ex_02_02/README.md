# WHAT
# The code introduces the concept of taking user input and respond to it
# Writing basic input and output
# The program prompts you the user for a name
# It will then store the name in a variable "name"
# Then prints a greeting with your name.

# WHY
# I can use it for personalized messages modifying them to interact to chatbots or greeting applications.
# Can use it to expand it by asking for a password and veryfying credentials
# Can also store names and other inputs for further processing in databases or files (dict with multpiple names)


# HOW
# This program uses input to prompt the user for their name 
# and then welcomes them
# You the user will then have to input Sarah in the box.
# then the program will wait for you the user to type something and press enter
# It then stores the input in a variable (name) then,
# prints the greeting.
