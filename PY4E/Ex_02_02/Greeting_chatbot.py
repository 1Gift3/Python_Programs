# Line Two uses an f-string which is a formatted string in python
# What it does is that it allow me to format selected parts of a string
# And to specify a string as an f-string you simply put an f in front of the string
# Wanting control over formatting of your out put rhan simply printing space separed value to format out put we begin a string with f or F before openning qoutation mark or triple qoutation.

# Placeholders and modifiers
# Now to format values in a n f-string -y youd need  placeholders {}
# Which {name} is a container but also can contain operations,functions and modifiers to format the value.
# WHen i remove fstring the it prints the statement as it is "Hello, {name}!..." without input or formating the input string.

# WHY
# Reason why we use it is cause its cleaner and more readerble than using "+" for string concactenation

# #.Lower()
# is a string method that converts all characters in astring to lowercase.

# WHy
# It ensure a consistent input handling takes place

# Got reminded on how to use emojis again Windows, + and period .
