Writting python Programs 

Bro Code and various selected initiaally with my project in mind.

I really had a Hard time working on my github to comming as my Auth was failling ova and over. so i took two weeks not comming but just working on programs - Learning that even if you leave it off for abit the problem will always be there. 
- So you can document the problem then come again seeking the Problem then documenting over and over
- Seek Problems , Document and repeat.  

I learned abit to push and pull from Machine.
On my ssh key was that i went ahead to my ssh folder on the system instead of also copying my pub key.
- so i generated a new SSH key and ensured both private (id_ed25519) and public (id_ed25519.pub) keys existed.
- You set the correct remote URL (git@github.com:1Gift3/Python_Programs.git) to use SSH instead of HTTPS
- You added the key to the SSH agent (ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519).
- You tested the connection (ssh -T git@github.com) to confirm everything was working.
