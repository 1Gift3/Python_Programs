Writting python Programs 

Bro Code and various selected initiaally with my project in mind.

I really had a Hard time working on my github to comming as my Auth was failling ova and over. so i took two weeks not comming but just working on programs - Learning that even if you leave it off for abit the problem will always be there. 
- So you can document the problem then come again seeking the Problem then documenting over and over
- Seek Problems , Document and repeat.
